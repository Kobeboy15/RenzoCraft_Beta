09:43 arcosanti placed suspicious WATER_BUCKET @ world: x226, z-773
09:46 Jhor      : Wax, how much melon would you get if you had a fortune 3 tool?
09:46 arcosanti : uh
09:46 arcosanti : im not sure
09:46 arcosanti : lemme search it
09:46 Jhor      : what about pumpkin?
09:47 arcosanti : so each level increases the max number of melon drop by 1
09:47 arcosanti : so from 3-7
09:47 arcosanti : the max becomes 10
09:47 arcosanti : the page doesnt say anything about pumpkins
09:47 Jhor      : Hmmm I see
09:48 arcosanti : so i guess thats where herbalism comes in
09:48 Jhor      : So what's more efficient, to silk touch melons or to fortune melons?
09:48 arcosanti : i think silk touch is way better
09:48 arcosanti : cuz that basically gives 9 melons every time
09:49 Jhor      : Hmm yeah I agree in the context of melons, but would my yield for pumpkins increase dramatically with fortune tho?
09:49 arcosanti : i dont think so
09:49 Jhor      : So silk touch the way to go all around you think?
09:50 arcosanti : yeeeep
