3.) Save
4.) Run Ngrok and bind your account to it using the authentication code provided by Ngrok.
5.) Inside the ngrok terminal, input the code to start up the server.
    (ngrok tcp -region "region-code" 25565)(region-code ex: ap -> "Asia-Pacific", us -> "United States")
6.) Once Ngrok is running, double click on the "run.bat" file to start the Minecraft Server.
